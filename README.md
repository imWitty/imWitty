Hi, I’m Alex Witt

My hobbies currently include gaming, music, the gym, and golf.
I’m currently studying at ASU to achieve both my bachelors and masters in software engineering.
I’m looking to learn as much as possible and willing to assist on any project that I can to help further my learning. 
I hope to one day be able to solely develop different ideas I have for apps, games, and products.
