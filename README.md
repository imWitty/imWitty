## Hi there, I'm Alexander Witt ðŸ‘‹  
----

Hey! I'm a student at ASU working towards both my bachelors and masters in software engineering. I am a veteran of the Marines and love sharing my experience with others in any way possible to help people grow and improve. I am proficient in Java, C/C++, SQL databases, HTML, Javascript, a few others and many common design ideologies. I hope to expand my knowledge as much as possible and eventually produce many ideas that I have for projects as I grow in software!

Actively Learning/Expanding knowledge - HTML (completing my certification), Javascript (Completing my certification), Swift (Learning, might attempt to complete a certication)

What I want to focus on next - AWS (using in a course and I see this around a lot), React (I see this in a lot of different job postings and want to be well rounded), C#(I like the idea of game development)

## 2024 Internship

I am actively looking for a summer 2024 internship. I hope to take this internship further and am even willing to hold employment during classes if the schedule lines up properly! I am very flexible and an extremely motivated worker. I believe that my work ethic is often unlike any that others have seen and I believe it is well complimented by my charismatic and friendly leadership/team oriented style.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm obviously actively pursuing my degree but outside of that I often spend time attempting to self-teach or complete software certificates! My biggest personal goal is to develop an iPhone app one day that I can tell others that I am proud to have created. I have many ideas for apps and also for other software I hope to develop someday.

## Languages & Tools
I am proficient in a variety of languages and software frameworks that allow me to build high-performance websites and applications. I have experience in the following areas:
