## Hi there, I'm Alexander Witt ðŸ‘‹  
----

Hey! I'm a student at ASU working towards both my bachelors and masters in software engineering. I am a veteran of the Marines and have over 5000 hours of technical training as a leader. This extensive background equips me with unique perspectives and skills, which I actively apply to enhance both my personal development and the growth of my team. I am proficient in Java, C/C++, SQL databases, HTML, Javascript, a few others and many common design ideologies. I hope to expand my knowledge as much as possible and eventually produce many ideas that I have for projects as I grow in software!

Actively Learning/Expanding knowledge - HTML (completing my certification), Javascript (Completing my certification), Swift (I plan to transition this into app development, I have many ideas that I am passionate about that I believe are either fun, helpful, or cutting edge for the market.)

What I want to focus on next - React (I want to strengthen my web development and believe that Reacts flexibility is the most useful way to be versatile. From my time as an aviation mechanic I realized that being versatile and knowledgable was one of the best feelings, the feeling of being reliable and knowledgable pushed me to learn more and know as much as I could. ), C# (I have always loved games as they have been a big part of my life and hobbies, as well as meeting many of the friends I keep close today. I would be passionate and proud of being able to create one.)

## 2024 Internship

I am actively looking for a summer 2024 internship. I am hungry to learn as much as possible from this internship and am open to working during the school semesters. I am very flexible and an extremely motivated worker. I believe that my work ethic is often unlike any that others have seen and I believe it is well complimented by my charismatic and friendly leadership/team oriented style.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I'm actively pursuing my degree but outside of that I often spend time attempting to self-teach or complete software certificates! One of my main aspirations is to create an iPhone app that I can proudly share with others and that reflects my personal interests as well.

## Languages & Tools
I am proficient in a variety of languages and software frameworks that allow me to build high-performance websites and applications. I have experience in the following areas:

## Hobbies // About Me - Unprofessionally
I am an avid gym goer and gamer. These two hobbies are my most common. I often go through different cycles for the gym and enjoy sharing my progress. I am a PC gamer and play just about everything! I am not much of a social media user outside of professional uses. I like to think of myself as pretty open to doing just about anything and trying new things! I love active hobbies such as golfing or sports all the way to indoor hobbies like games and watching movies. I recently have started getting into rock climbing, it has been a blast and extremely challenging. I am a trivia addict and love anything that deals with *attempting* to be smart in order to answer (crosswords, trivia, games like wordle). I am both reserved and talkative. I tend to be extremely friendly and like to ease tensions with a relaxed approach and demeanor. I am always open to speaking my mind, challenging ideas, or asking questions but this does not mean it has to be in a rude way, mostly it is intended to be inqusitive or offer unique approaches, because either myself or the person I am asking may not understand the situation fully and need clarification.
